# Building Python Packages
## What is a python package and what are the advantages?
### Structure


- Step 1 `create an app folder`.
- Step 2 inside app folder create empty `__init__.py` to initialize our package.
- Step 3 inside the app folder create `fizzbuzz.py` to add our functionality.
- Step 4 create  a `program.py` on dir level to use as run file.
- `setup.py` on dir level to describe our module details, such as version, author and contact details.


```python
